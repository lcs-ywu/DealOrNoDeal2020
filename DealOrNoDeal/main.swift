// Create the array with briefcase values

// getBriefcaseOpened
//
// PURPOSE:
//
// Asks the user for a briefcase that is opened during a turn, as shown in the example.
// When the input is invalid, the prompt is repeated.
//
// INPUT / PARAMETERS:
//
// What turn it is
//
// OUTPUT / RETURN VALUE:
//
// An integer between 1 and 10, inclusive
func getBriefcaseOpened(onTurn turn: Int) -> Int {
    
    // STUDENTS: Complete this function
    
    
    // The statement below can be modified
    return 0
    
}

// Loop and ask what briefcases have been opened
for turn in 1...briefcasesOpened {
    
    // Get which briefcase was opened
    let briefcaseOpenedThisTime = getBriefcaseOpened(onTurn: turn)
    
    // STUDENTS: Now that you know what briefcase is opened... what might you do to the array value(s)?
    briefcaseValues[briefcaseOpenedThisTime - 1] = 0

// STUDENTS: Do any remaining calculations you might need below.
